Customers who wish to   buy a   car   can   use   this   calculator   to   compare   loan   repayments,   to   see whether they can afford the   repayments for their   preferred car.   Customers   only   need   to   choose   the   car model and enter the amount they   can   pay each week to   payoff the   loan.   Assume   that   the   customer   needs   to take a   loan for the full   cost   of   the   car.

1. Car Model (B4)
•          The customer   must choose from   a drop-down list of   cars   available   for   sale.   (The Car List is
shown at the   bottom of the spreadsheet.)   Include suitable   input   and   error   messages.   For this   activity, choose the car   model Kia Picanto from the   list.
2.          How much can you afford to repay each week? (E4) 
•          The customer   must type   in a   value that   they   can   afford   to   pay   each   week. This   must   be   a   whole   number.   Include suitable   input and error   messages.   For this   activity, type   in the   value $100. 
Tip: format this cell to   currency. 
Insert appropriate functions or formulas that will automatically calculate the   following:
3. Cost of Car (C4)
•          This cell will display the   cost   of the   car   based   on   the   car   model   chosen   by   the   customer   referring to the Cars for Sale table.
4. Monthly Repayment including Insurance (D4)
•          This cell will display the   monthly   repayment   (assume 4 weeks per month)   to   be   made   for   the   full cost of the car,   based on theYearly Interest Rate (row   14), Loan Period (Years) (row   15), and Insurance (Monthly) (row   11).
5. Affordable Loan? (F4)
•          If the   loan   is   affordable   (the   customer   is able   to   repay   the   monthly   repayment   including   insurance) the cell should display Yes.      If the   loan   is   not   affordable, the   word No will   be      displayed.
•          Apply conditional formatting so   that   the   cell   is   shaded   yellow   and   the   text   is   red   if No is   displayed
•          Test this formula   by changing the   values   in   cells   B4   and   E4.
6. Formatting 
•          Format this worksheet   so that   all   information   is clear and easy to read.
